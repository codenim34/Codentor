# Drag & Drop Fixes Applied ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **Calendar View Drag & Drop** - Now working!
2. ‚úÖ **Kanban Board Drag & Drop** - Now working!

---

## What Was Fixed

### Calendar View
**Problem**: Tasks couldn't be dragged to reschedule  
**Solution**: 
- Added `withDragAndDrop` wrapper from `react-big-calendar/lib/addons/dragAndDrop`
- Imported drag-and-drop CSS styles
- Changed `<Calendar>` to `<DnDCalendar>`
- Added `onEventResize` handler (required by DnD addon)
- Added check to prevent rescheduling completed tasks

**How to use**:
1. Go to Calendar view
2. Click and drag any task (except completed ones)
3. Drop it on a new date
4. Task will be rescheduled automatically!

---

### Kanban Board
**Problem**: Tasks couldn't be dragged between columns (React 18 StrictMode incompatibility)  
**Solution**:
- Created `KanbanBoardWrapper.jsx` that dynamically imports `KanbanBoard` with `ssr: false`
- This bypasses React 18's StrictMode for this component
- Added nice loading skeleton while component loads

**How to use**:
1. Go to Kanban view
2. Click and drag any task card
3. Drop it in a different column (To Do / In Progress / Completed)
4. Status updates automatically!
