# CodeLab Fixes Summary âœ…

## All 3 Issues Fixed!

### 1. âœ… Fixed Header Navigation - "Code Lab" now links to `/codelab`
**Problem:** Clicking "Code Lab" in header went to `/roadmaps`  
**Solution:** Updated `app/components/Header.jsx`
- Changed link from `/roadmaps` to `/codelab`
- Separated "Playground" as its own link

**Before:**
```javascript
{ href: "/roadmaps", label: "Roadmaps" },
{ href: "/playground", label: "Code Lab" },
```

**After:**
```javascript
{ href: "/codelab", label: "Code Lab" },
{ href: "/playground", label: "Playground" },
```

### 2. âœ… Fixed Participant Count & Display
**Problem:** Participant count was wrong and not showing who's online  
**Solution:** 
- Updated `app/codelab/[roomCode]/page.jsx` to properly display participants
- Shows **actual usernames** with first letter avatars
- Displays up to 5 participants with "+X more" for additional users
- Real-time updates when people join/leave

**What You'll See:**
- Correct count (e.g., "3 online")
- Circular avatars with user initials
- Hover to see full username
- Purple/pink gradient avatars for visual appeal

---

### 3. âœ… Added Shareable Link Feature
**Problem:** No easy way to share the session  
**Solution:** Added **Share button** with full URL copying

**How It Works:**
1. Click the blue **"Share"** button in header
2. Full URL copied to clipboard (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/codelab/ABC12345`)
3. Anyone with link can join
4. New joiners see the **current code** and **language**, not defaults!

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Server stores room state (code + language) in `app/api/socket/route.js`
- When someone joins, they receive current state via `roomState` event
- No more seeing default JavaScript snippet when joining!

## How to Test

### Test 1: Header Navigation
1. Click "Code Lab" in header
2. Should go to `/codelab` (not roadmaps) âœ…

### Test 2: Participant Count
1. Open CodeLab session
2. Copy the share link
3. Open in incognito/different browser
4. Watch participant count update: "1 online" â†’ "2 online" âœ…
5. See both user avatars with initials âœ…

### Test 3: Shareable Link with Code Sync
1. User A: Create session, write some Python code
2. User A: Click "Share" button
3. User A: Send link to User B
4. User B: Open the link
5. User B should see:
   - âœ… Python language selected (not JavaScript)
   - âœ… The exact code User A wrote (not default snippet)
   - âœ… Both users in participant list

### Test 4: Real-Time Everything
1. Both users in same room
2. User A types code â†’ User B sees it âœ…
3. User A changes language â†’ User B's language changes âœ…
4. User A leaves â†’ Count updates to "1 online" âœ…

## Technical Details

### Room State Management
The server now maintains:
```javascript
{
  code: "current code in editor",
  language: "current language selected"
}
```

### Events Flow
1. **Join**: User joins â†’ Server sends `roomState` â†’ User sees current code/language
2. **Code Change**: User types â†’ Server stores + broadcasts â†’ All users sync
3. **Language Change**: User changes lang â†’ Server stores + broadcasts â†’ All users switch
4. **Leave**: User leaves â†’ Server updates count â†’ All users see new count
